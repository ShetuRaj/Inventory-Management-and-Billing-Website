## MySQL database setup and congfiguration

Install MySQL

```bash
  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
```

MySQL Installation Guide

```bash
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u96rVINbAUI
```
Download mysql database **.sql** file from here

```bash
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0zaU-5Jzvf8aAqs4a-yiOMHxdkR5Y87/view?usp=sharing
```
Open mysql command prompt(as Administrator) and run the following command:-

```bash
  create database warehousedb;
```

Copy that sql file into this location (Your MySQL Server version could be different)
```bash
  C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
```

Now open command prompt(as Administrator) and execute following commands
```bash
  cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
  mysql –u root –p warehousedb < warehousedb.sql
```
  
## Install node dependencies and run server locally

Clone the project (You can also download this project directly as a zip file by clicking on **Code** present on top of this page and then clicking **Download Zip**)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ShetuRaj/Inventory-Management-and-Billing-Website.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Inventory-Management-and-Billing-Website
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```


Start the server (Please set up the environment variables before starting the server)

```bash
  npm run start
```

  
## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file (Create a file named `.env` at the root of your project directory, i.e., in **Inventory-Management-and-Billing-Website** folder)

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=secret

db_name=warehousedb

db_user_name=<database_user_name>

db_password=<database_password>

login_id=<login_email_address>

login_password=<password_for_login>
```


Here `login_id` and `login_password` are the login credentials for the website. Similarly `db_user_name` and `db_password` are the credenials for the MySQL database which was configured during installation of MySQL. So please change all the credentials accordingly. 
Leave `SESSION_SECRET=secret` and `db_name=warehousedb` as it is.

Folowing is an example with actual values in a .env file:-

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=secret

db_name=warehousedb

db_user_name=root

db_password=root1234

login_id=admin@xyz.com

login_password=admin1234
```
  
In the `.env` file, don't use double quotes for values and there should be no space before or after `=`. Also you can edit the shop name and other details on the bill pdf generated by simply going to **views/bill.ejs** and editing lines `488` to `494` in the file
